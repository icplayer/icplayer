## Description
The Slideshow addon allows users to embed a slideshow presentation together with the corresponding audio recording.

**Note:** Image Viewer supports the following graphic formats: JPG, PNG, BMP. Vector formats are not supported.

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: It's recommended to use files with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate">bitrate</a> 64 kb/s or higher. The files with lower quality could experience some difficulties in reproduction.
It's also important that audio files have <strong>constant bitrate</strong> because Mozilla Firefox experiences problems while seeking in the files that have variable bitrate mode.
