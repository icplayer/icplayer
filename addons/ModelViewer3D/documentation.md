## Description

##### Model Viewer 3D allows for displaying 3D models. <br> Please note that when using a mobile device, an additional <img src="/file/serve/6093598547116032" style="border: 0; display:inline; margin: 0 2px; box-shadow: none" alt="AR"> icon will be visible in the vicinity of the 3D model. Interacting with the icon allows switching the preview to the Augmented Reality mode ([https://modelviewer.dev/examples/augmentedreality](https://modelviewer.dev/examples/augmentedreality "https://modelviewer.dev/examples/augmentedreality")).

        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Model</td>
        <td>Path to the file containing the 3D model. Supports only the glTF/GLB 3D models.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Poster</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Annotations</td>
        <td>Additional text displayed in the preview.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Environment Image</td>
        <td>Controls the environmental reflection of the model. Normally, if skybox-image is set, that image will also be used for the environment-image.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Skybox Image</td>
        <td>Sets the background image of the scene. Takes a URL to an equirectangular projection image that is used for the skybox, as well as applied as an environment map on the model. Supports PNG, HDR, and JPG images.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Shadow Intensity</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Shadow Softness</td>

        <td>Automatically slowly rotates the model.</td>

## Fullscreen

In order for an addon to start supporting fullscreen functionality, it must:
<ul>
    <li>Support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API">Fullscreen API</a>. At this point, iphones do not support the Fullscreen API.</li>
    <li>The `Enable fullscreen` property must be selected.</li>
</ul>

When these conditions are met, the addon will:
<ul>
    <li>Show in view a button that allows to enter in fullscreen mode.</li>
    <li>Allow to use `requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen` commands.</li>
</ul>

When `Enable fullscreen` property is selected the content of the addon will be wrapped with an element with CSS class `.modelViewerWrapper`, regardless of whether the device supports Fullscreen API
