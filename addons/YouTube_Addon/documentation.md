YouTube addon doesn't expose any CSS classes because its internal structure should not be changed (neither via Advanced Connector nor CSS styles).

## Posible errors

    <tr>
        <th>Error message</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Video ID seems to be incorrect!</td>
        <td>This error message suggests that video ID was set incorrectly. For most cases it means that user pasted video URL instead of its ID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Neither a video ID nor a URL has been given!</td>
        <td>This error message is shown when neither video ID nor URL was set in Addon configuration</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>URL seems to be incorrect!</td>
        <td>This error message is shown if Addon wasn't able o extract video ID from URL. Remember that URL has to be from .com or .be domain!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>URL seems to be incorrect. It must contain a video ID!</td>
        <td>It's a common mistake to set a video URL without a video ID. If this is the case, then this error message will be shown</td>
