## Description
A Crossword addon allows inserting a Crossword game into a presentation. It's enough to predefine some specific parameters to make it work.

## Properties

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Property

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Crossword</td>
      <td>Defines crossword. It has to be written like this:<br />

<pre>
ENGLISH
···O···
·NEVER·
·E·E···
·W·····
</pre>

(in the above example spaces were replaced with dots, use spaces in real environment to indicate blank cells).

In other words, it is just a text representation of a crossword. Spaces indicate blank cells, anything other indicates a place for a letter. You must ensure that the amount of characters in each row is equal (including leading and trailing spaces) and it is equal to the value in the Columns property. Amount of rows has to be equal to the value in the Rows property.

While numbering of words is done automatically, you have to put their descriptions and hints to the user in a separate text module.

If you would like to make a letter visible from start, simply type an exclamation mark before this letter, e.g. in order to put the letters 'E', 'N', and 'G' permanently in the word 'ENGLISH', then the whole word should look like this: '!E!N!GLISH'

        <td>Auto navigation</td>
        <td>Auto navigation for editable cells in a crossword.

            Auto navigation uses an algorithm that, based on data (such as the currently selected cell in the crossword, neighboring cells, and the user's last action), determines the direction of cursor movement when the user attempts to fill in the crossword cell. The rules of the algorithm are described below.
			
			There are three directions of movement for auto navigation:
			<ul>
				<li><b>horizontal</b></li>
				<li><b>vertical</b></li>
				<li><b>TabIndex direction</b> &ndash; see description below</li>
			</ul>

			Auto navigation modes:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Extended</b> &ndash; Auto navigation works in any of the directions listed above. In this mode, if there is no next editable cell for the crossword then auto navigation will not point to the next cell. This is the default mode.</li>
				<li><b>Simple</b> &ndash; Auto navigation works in vertical and horizontal directions. In this mode, if there is no next editable cell for the currently filled in word, the auto-navigation stops pointing to the next cell.</li>
				<li><b>Off</b> &ndash; Auto navigation is turned off.</li>
			</ul>

## Events

*ValueChanged event*

When a user types a letter into the crossword and leaves the cell, the ValueChanged event is sent.
Its structure is shown below.

<table border='1'>
    <tr>
        <th>Field name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Item</td>
        <td>[y][x] <em>(where x and y are coordinates of the cell)</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Value</td>
        <td><em>inserted letter</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Score</td>
        <td>1 <em>if letter is correct</em>, 0 <em>otherwise</em></td>
    </tr>
</table>

*AllOK event*

When a user fills in all cells properly, the addon sends the 'ALL OK' event. This event is different from a normal event so its structure is shown below.

<table border='1'>
    <tr>
        <th>Field name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Item</td>
        <td>all</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Value</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Score</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
</table>

*CorrectWord event*

When a user fills in a correct word, the CorrectWord event is sent.
This event has the following structure:

<table border='1'>
    <tr>
        <th>Field name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Item</td>
        <td><em>Numer of the word</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Value</td>
        <td><em>The correct word</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Score</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
</table>


Advanced Connector example:

<pre>
EVENTSTART
Name:CorrectWord
Source:crossword1
SCRIPTSTART

presenter.playerController.getModule('feedback1').change('1');

SCRIPTEND
EVENTEND
</pre>


##Show Answers

This module is fully compatible with [Show Answers module](/doc/page/Show-Answers "Show Answers module") and displays correct answers when adequate event is sent.

## eKeyboard integration
It is possible to enter text into cells using the eKeyboard module. 

[See the documentation of eKeyboard module &raquo;](/doc/page/eKeyboard "eKeyboard")

        <td>.crossword_cell_show-answers</td>
        <td>Indicates the look of cells in the show answers mode.</td> 
    </tr>

</tbody>
</table>

Please note that in practice, styles related to the cell position (.cell_AxB, .cell_row_X, .cell_column_X) have to be combined with another style that indicates a type of cell, e.g.

* .cell_column_3.cell_letter will apply only to cells with letters in column 4,
* .cell_row_0.cell_blank  will apply only to cells without letters in row 1.

###Examples

**1.1. Make font bigger:**  

    .crossword_bigfont {
    }

    .crossword_bigfont .cell_letter input {
        font-size: 24pt;
    }

**1.2. Green background, only cells with a letters are visible:**  

* Set _Blank cells border width_  to 0
* Set _Letter cells border width_  to 1
* Set _Letter cells border color_  to #aaa

<pre>
.crossword_green {
    background: #D6FFE9;
}

.crossword_green .cell_container_blank {
    background: transparent;
}

.crossword_green .cell_container_letter {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 2px 2px #ccc;
}

.crossword_green .cell_invalid {
    background: #fff;
}

.crossword_green .cell_invalid input {
    color: #aa0000;
    text-decoration: line-through;
    font-weight: bold;
}

## Auto navigation algorithm

In order to better understand the algorithm, a legend has been created with a description of the elements. 

Legend:
<table border="1">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>blank cell</b></td>
			<td>Cell that does not belong to the crossword.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>constant cell</b></td>
			<td>Cell with initial, non-editable value.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>editable cell</b></td>
			<td>Editable cell.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>current word</b></td>
			<td>One of the words whose <b>editable cell</b> is pointed to by the cursor. The <b>current word</b> consists only of <b>editable cells</b> and <b>constant cells</b>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>TabIndex direction</b></td>
			<td>Direction for the auto navigation cursor to point to the next <b>editable cell</b> to the right, regardless of whether the next cell belongs to the same word. If movement in the right direction is not possible then cursor is moved to the leftmost <b>editable cell</b> from the next row.</td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Algorithm rules/sequential steps of the algorithm:
<ol>
	<li>If the current direction is horizontal and there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> on the right side in the <b>current word</b>, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> on the right side.</li>
	<li>If the current direction is horizontal and there is not at least one <b>editable cell</b> to the right side in the <b>current word</b>, then move using the <b>TabIndex direction</b>.</li>
	<li>If the current direction is vertical and there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> below it in the <b>current word</b>, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> below it.</li>
	<li>If the current direction is vertical and there is not at least one <b>editable cell</b> below it in the <b>current word</b>, then move using the <b>TabIndex direction</b>.</li>
	<li>If there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> below it in the <b>current word</b>, and if the right cell is an <b>blank cell</b>, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> below it.</li>
	<li>If there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> on the right side in the <b>current word</b>, and if the top cell and the bottom cell are <b>blank cells</b>, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> on the right side.</li>
	<li>If there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> below it in the <b>current word</b>, and if the top cell is an <b>blank cell</b> and the right cell is not an <b>blank cell</b>, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> below it.</li>
	<li>If there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> below in the <b>current word</b>, and if the right cell is not an <b>blank cell</b> that the user has filled in, and the cell at the bottom is not an <b>blank cell</b> that the user has not filled in, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> below.</li>
	<li>If there is at least one <b>editable cell</b> on the right side in the <b>current word</b>, then move to the first possible <b>editable cell</b> on the right side.</li>
	<li>Use the TabIndex direction.</li>
</ol>

<b>Note:</b> The rules of the algorithm are checked from the first rule to the last. This means that rule 1 will be checked first, then rule 2, and so on. If any rule has all conditions satisfied, then the next rules are not checked.


<b>Note:</b> If the auto-navigation mode does not allow chosen direction, then the navigation will not move cursor to the next cell. For example, if the auto-navigation mode is set to Simple and the direction analysis shows the <b>TabIndex direction</b>, then cursor will not be moved to the next cell.


In short, the following directions are used for the following rules:
<ul>
	<li>1, 6, 9 &ndash; horizontal direction</li>
	<li>3, 5, 7, 8 &ndash; vertical direction</li>
	<li>2, 4, 10 &ndash; <b>TabIndex direction</b></li>
</ul>
