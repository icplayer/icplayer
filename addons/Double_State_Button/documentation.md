## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by the Double State Button module can be used in the Advanced Connector module's scripts. The examples below show how to enable the button when the True/False module sends an event about the correct answer and how to disable it when the user selects the incorrect answer.

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:1
        SCRIPTSTART

            var doubleButton = presenter.playerController.getModule('DSB1');
            doubleButton.enable();

        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:0
        SCRIPTSTART

            var doubleButton = presenter.playerController.getModule('DSB1');
            doubleButton.disable();

        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

## Events
The Double State Button module sends ValueChanged type events to the Event Bus when the user selects or deselects it.
