## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by the Double State Button addon can be used in the Advanced Connector addon's scripts. The below examples show how to enable the button when True/False addon will send event about correct answer and how to disable it when event means that a user selects the incorrect answer.

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:1
        SCRIPTSTART
            var doubleButton = presenter.playerController.getModule('DSB1');
            doubleButton.enable();
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND
        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:0
        SCRIPTSTART
            var doubleButton = presenter.playerController.getModule('DSB1');
            doubleButton.disable();
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

## Events
Double State Button addon sends ValueChanged type events to Event Bus when either user selects or deselects it.

Note that the addon's size is the same in every state so properties responsible for dimensions (i.e. width, height, border/margin/padding size) should be consistent across all states.
