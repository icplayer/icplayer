The TextAudio addon allows users to play sounds with subtitles in their presentations. This addon works on all common browsers. 

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: It's recommended to use files with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate">bitrate</a> 64 kb/s or higher. The files with lower quality could experience some difficulties in reproduction.
It's also important that audio files have <strong>constant bitrate</strong> because Mozilla Firefox may experience problems while seeking in files that have variable bitrate mode.

        <td>Slides</td>
        <td>In this property you define slides with the audio narration. Each slide has property Text – which is the content of the slide and property Times, in which you define durations of each slide.
		<br />
		The content of the slide can be divided into fragments that will be highlighted in different periods of time. The seperator is double pipe "||". The number of pieces of text should be the same as the number of time periods in the Times property.
		<br />
		In the <strong>Times property</strong> you define time ranges for each piece of text. The time should be in the following format: mm:ss.d, where mm is minute, ss is second and d is the tenth of a second. Time range for each text should be in the seperate line. The tenth of a second parameter is not obligatory.<br> In the <strong>Position and dimensions</strong> property you define the position of a slide. This should be in the following format: X;Y;W;H, where X is the position from left, Y is the position from top, W is width and H is height.
		<br />
		<strong>For example:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Text:</strong><br />Lorem ||ipsum ||dolor</li>
			<li><strong>Times:</strong><br />
			00:00-00:02<br />
			00:02-00:03.5<br />

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: It's important to put 2 different file formats if you want your audio to work on all common browsers. If you don't have a file in ogg format, you can use this <a href="http://media.io/">mp3 to ogg converter.</a> In Safari browser the file size is limited ( ~4mb ).
</div>

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: Due to the policy of Android and iOS systems, using "onEnd" property to play another media element will not work on mobile devices as it requires user interaction.

## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by the TextAudio addon can be used in the Advanced Connector addon scripts. The below examples show how to play sound when the True/False addon sends an event for the correct answer and how to stop it when the event indicates the incorrect answer.

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:1
        SCRIPTSTART
            var audio = presenter.playerController.getModule('TextAudio1');
            audio.play();
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:0
        SCRIPTSTART
            var audio = presenter.playerController.getModule('TextAudio1');
            audio.stop();
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

## Events
