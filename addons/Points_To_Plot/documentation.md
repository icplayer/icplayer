If you are using [Advanced Connector](/doc/page/Advanced-Connector), please note that due to the Regular Expression syntax, which has special meaning for "-" and "." characters, you need to escape them with backshlash, e.g. point_\-5\.2_4\.5

The „All OK” event is sent when all answers given in a Plot activity are 100% correct.
