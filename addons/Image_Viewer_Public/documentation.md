## Description
This addon allows users to embed simple animations where new frames are shown on a mouse click. It also allows users to add a sound notification on a changing frame. It supports 3 audio formats:

* MP3
* OGG Vorbis
* AAC

Additionally, this addon is extended with frame names. These frame names were added to integrate Image Viewer with the Image Gap addon. Of course it can serve other purposes - possibilities are limited to the author's imagination.

**Note:** Image Viewer supports the following graphic formats: JPG, PNG, BMP. Vector formats are not supported.

## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by Image Viewer addon can be used in the Advanced Connector addon scripts. The below example shows how to react on Text module gap content changes (i.e. throughout putting in it elements from Source List) and change displayed frame accordingly.

        EVENTSTART
        Source:Text2
        Value:1
        SCRIPTSTART
            var imageViewer = presenter.playerController.getModule('Image_Viewer_Public1');
            imageViewer.moveToFrame(1);
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND
        EVENTSTART
        Source:Text2
        Value:2
        SCRIPTSTART
            var imageViewer = presenter.playerController.getModule('Image_Viewer_Public1');
            imageViewer.moveToFrame(2);
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND
        EVENTSTART
        Source:Text2
        Value:3
        SCRIPTSTART
            var imageViewer = presenter.playerController.getModule('Image_Viewer_Public1');
            imageViewer.moveToFrame(3);
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND
        EVENTSTART
        Source:Text2
        Value:4
        SCRIPTSTART
            var imageViewer = presenter.playerController.getModule('Image_Viewer_Public1');
            imageViewer.moveToFrame(4);

Addon accepts all CSS selectors and modificators, i.e. if user would like to specify a different appearance for image on mouse hover, a CSS declaration could look like this:<br/><br/>
.Image_Viewer_Public_custom {<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
.Image_Viewer_Public_custom .image-viewer {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 2px solid black;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<b>.Image_Viewer_Public_custom .image-viewer:hover</b> {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 2px solid red;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
This declaration will result in red border on mouse hover over Addon.
