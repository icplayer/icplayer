Commands marked with '*' have additional parameter which can disable sending events to Event Bus (helpful when in Advanced Connector user wants to manipulate one Slider from another). To disable sending events just add 'false' parameter (with single quotes characters) like in example below.

    EVENTSTART
    Source:Text2
    SCRIPTSTART
        var sliderModule = presenter.playerController.getModule('Slider1');
        sliderModule.moveTo(2, 'false');
        sliderModule.show();
    SCRIPTEND
    EVENTEND

## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by the Slider addon can be used in the Advanced Connector addon's scripts. The below example shows how to display the hidden module and move it to step 2.

    EVENTSTART
    Source:Text2
    SCRIPTSTART
        var sliderModule = presenter.playerController.getModule('Slider1');
        sliderModule.moveTo(2);
        sliderModule.show();
    SCRIPTEND
    EVENTEND

## Events
The Slider addon sends ValueChanged type events to Event Bus when a step is changed. On every step change the addon sends two events - one for leaving a current step and other for entering a new one.
