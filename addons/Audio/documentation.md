The Audio addon allows users to play sounds in their presentations. This addon works on all common browsers. For Internet Explorer 9 you have to use mp3 format, for others ogg format.

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: It's recommended to use files with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate">bitrate</a> 64 kb/s or higher. Files with lower quality could have difficulties with reproduction.

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: It's important to put 2 different format files if you want your audio to work on all common browsers. If you don't have a file in ogg format, you can use this <a href="http://media.io/">mp3 to ogg converter.</a> In Safari browser the file size is limited ( ~4mb ).
</div>

<div style="border:1px solid Tomato; padding:5px; margin-bottom:21px;">
Note: Due to the policy of Android and iOS systems, using "onEnd" property to play another media element will not work on mobile devices as it requires user interaction.

## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by the Audio addon can be used in the Advanced Connector addon scripts. The below examples show how to play sound when the True/False addon sends an event about the correct answer and how to stop it when the event indicates the incorrect answer.

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:1
        SCRIPTSTART
            var audio = presenter.playerController.getModule('Audio1');
            audio.play();
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

        EVENTSTART
        Source:TrueFalse1
        Score:0
        SCRIPTSTART
            var audio = presenter.playerController.getModule('Audio1');
            audio.stop();
        SCRIPTEND
        EVENTEND

## Events
