## Description
This Addon allows conducting a competition and scoring the points won by multiple teams. Number of teams, their names and points can be modify in the runtime of lesson.

Addon Scoreboard has two modes of working:

* One-page mode
* Multiple pages lesson mode

**One-page mode** - is turned on if *Variable Storage id* property is empty.  
**Multiple-page mode** - is turned on if *Variable Storage id* property is fulfilled and Variable Storage is correctly configured.

## Multiple-page mode configuration

To configure Scoreboard to work in multiple-page mode creator has to add Variable Storage addon to Common part of lesson (header/footer).
It can be added either in header or footer.
If Variable Storage addon was added to footer, redactor has to change default Variable Storage location and Variable Storage properties to correctly point new Variable Storage location. By default, the values are set to point to Variable Storage located in the header.

Next step is to copy the created Scoreboard addon to each page where we want to use it in multiple-page mode. If configuration is correct Scoreboard should store values between pages of the lesson in the Variable Storage addon.

### Multiple-page with IWB_Toolbar integration

To integrate Scoreboard with IWB_Toolbar you have to check "Has custom button" property and induce show() and hide() commands on Scoreboard addon inside IWB_Toolbar "On custom button selected" and "On custom button deselected".

Example "On custom button selected" property:

```Scoreboard1.show();```

Example "On custom button deselected" property:

```Scoreboard1.hide();```

Scoreboard1 in the examples above refers to Scoreboard addon id. To handle deselect of custom button when user close Scoreboard manually you have to add Advanced Connector. 

Details can be found in the penultimate subsection "Advance Connector integration".
It is also advisable to initially hide the Scoreboard addon as the custom button is not pressed by default.
