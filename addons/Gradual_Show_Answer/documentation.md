## Description

The Gradual Show Answers addon allows the user to switch on the Gradual Show Answers mode.

If the button is in default mode (Hide Answers Mode â€“ off), selecting the button will show all answers on a page one by one.

If the button is in Hide Answers Mode, selecting the button will hide all the already displayed answers one by one and reset their progress.

The Gradual Show Answers addon also allows working with specific components on a page.
This can be achieved by writing components' IDs in "Works with" attribute. 
Supported elements should be listed there, each in a new line.
