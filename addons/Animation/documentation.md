## Advanced Connector integration
Each command supported by the Animation addon can be used in Advanced Connector addon's scripts. Below example shows how to show and play the animation when a user selects the correct answer in a TrueFalse activity and how to stop it and hide it when the answer is incorrect.

    EVENTSTART
    Source:TrueFalse1
    Score:1
    SCRIPTSTART
        var animation = presenter.playerController.getModule('Animation1');
        animation.show();
        animation.play();
    SCRIPTEND
    EVENTEND
    EVENTSTART
    Source:TrueFalse1
    Score:0
    SCRIPTSTART
        var animation = presenter.playerController.getModule('Animation1');

The Addon accepts all CSS selectors and modificators, e.g. if a user would like to specify separate appearance for a preview image on mouse hover, a CSS declaration could look like this:<br/><br/>
.Animation_custom {<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
.Animation_custom .animation-image-preview {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 2px solid black;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<b>.Animation_custom .animation-image-preview:hover</b> {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 2px solid red;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
This declaration will result in a red border over the addon's preview image on mouse hover.
