## Description

The Zoom module allows to zoom in on a lesson page (`.ic_page` element) and interact with modules while zoomed in.

If the lesson page does not fit on the screen then note that the zoomed in area will also not fit on the page. 
However, using the scroll, it will be possible to get to the specified area. For this reason, it is recommended to 
test if the set width and height of the addon for the mobile layout is sufficient so that the user does not have to 
scroll too much.

Addons embedded in the header and footer that need scale information (like Ordering module) will work incorrectly 
when zoomed in by the Zoom addon (even if neither header nor footer is zoomed in).

Addon must not be placed in the header or footer to work properly.

## Requirements
If the content of the player is scaled then to make addon work, it is necessary to set the scale information 
using the `player.setScaleInformation` command. 
Learn more about scale information by visiting the 
[Modules description](doc/en/scale%20information/page/Scale-Information) section.

## Properties
The list starts with the common properties, learn more about them by visiting the
