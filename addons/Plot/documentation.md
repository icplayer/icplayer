##Description
Plot drawing/exercise module allows users to present plots and make plot/points based activities. Plot enables to draw functions f(x) and f(y).

Addon may work in 4 modes:

- simple plot functions - set all expressions/selectable and expressions/correct  to false

- choose function - user has to select correct plot - define all clickable functions to true (expressions/selectable) and set appropriate answers (expressions/correct)

- choose points - if user defines points, module shows clickable points on grid intersections. It is important to note that the answer should be a point on that intersection. It must be defined which points are correct.

- the addon can work as a base module for plot type addons and communicate with them through the interface.

Addon is able to work in a mixed mode eg. simple plot + choose plot + choose points.

If you are using [Advanced Connector](/doc/page/Advanced-Connector), please note that due to Regular Expression syntax which has special meaning for "-" and "." characters, you need to escape them with backshlash eg. point_\-5\.2_4\.5

When a user makes all connections properly without any error, the addon sends the 'ALL OK' event.

Additionally you are able to override style for each plot by setting .draw_X, .draw_X_over, .draw_X_selected, where X is number (1..X) of plot.
  
##Expressions
The parser accepts a pretty basic grammar. Operators have the normal precidence — ^ (exponentiation), *, /, and % (multiplication, division, and remainder), and finally +, - — and bind from left to right. Eg. x+2; x^2+2; x+sin(x); x-5*cos(2*x)	

The parser has several built-in “functions” that are actually operators.

##Defining variables
Let's assume you have a plot a\*x\+ b. Normally you can write expression like 3\*x\+5, but if you want to change value of a and/or b dynamically (eg. by slider/button) you have to use Variables section.
Give a plot id, eg. 'p1', write expression a\*x\+b. Plot addon is expecting values for a and b in Variables section.

Now go to Variables and create list of 2 items. Item 1 - set plot id 'p1', name variable as 'a' and set value eg. 3. In Item 2 - set plot id' p1', variable 'b', value 5. 

Addon is able to parse plot 'p1' in form of a\*x\+b as 3\*x\+5

## Demo presentation
[Demo presentation](/embed/4505122450178048 "Demo presentation") contains examples of how to use the Plot addon and integrate it with other Addons, i.e. Slider, buttons.
