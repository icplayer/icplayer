## Description

A Points and Lines addon enables you to present a set of points on a plane where by choosing two points you can draw or remove a segment connecting the two points. 
This can be used as an activity or as a presentation/simulation.

The Addon supports both click & click and drag & drop operating methods. You may choose a more convenient gesture depending on the situation and the device being used.
