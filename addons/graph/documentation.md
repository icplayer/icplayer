        <th>Class name</th>
        <th>Description</th> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_serie_size</td>
        <td>indicates the look of series (rows from the "data" property). If you want to add margin between each of the series, use "left" CSS property with fixed value in pixels</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_value_size</td>
        <td>indicates the look of values, represented as vertical bars (rows' items from the "data" property). If you want to add margin between each of the bars, use "left" CSS property with fixed value in pixels</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_container_outer</td>
        <td>indicates the look of the most outer container of the graph</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_container_inner</td>
        <td>indicates the look of the container that provides a margin between outer container and the graph. Default margin is 10px. If you want to adjust it, use "top", "left", "right" and "bottom" CSS properties</td>

        <td>.graph_grid</td>
        <td>indicates the look of the container that contains grid, use "display" CSS property to disable grid</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_grid_block_below</td>
        <td>indicates the look of the grid lines that are located below X axis, use "border-bottom" CSS property to change look of the grid line</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_grid_description</td>
        <td>indicates the look of the Y axis values, located on the left side of Y axis, near grid lines</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_axis_description</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>.graph_value_element</td>
        <td>indicates the look of bars. <br /><br />

Note about borders: if you want to set border, use this CSS class to set only "border-left" and "border-right". As top and bottom border can affect positioning of elements, bars that represent positive values should have set only top border and bars that represent negative values should have set only bottom border. For such purpose please use .graph_value_element_positive and .graph_value_element_negative classes, respectively.<br /><br />

Note about errors: if you want to style bars during error checking mode, use .graph_value_element_valid and .graph_value_element_invalid respectively for valid and invalid elements. Rules for borders apply also during this mode.</td>

###Examples

**1.1. Make bigger spaces between series and smaller between bars:**  

    .graph_xx {
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_serie_size {
        left: 12px;
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_size {
        left: 2px;
    }

**1.2. Make bars' borders pink on invalid answers and yellow on valid answers:**  

    .graph_xx {
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_element_valid {
        border-left-color: yellow;
        border-right-color: yellow;
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_element_positive_valid {
        border-top-color: yellow;
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_element_negative_valid {
        border-bottom-color: yellow;
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_element_invalid {
        border-left-color: pink;
        border-right-color: pink;
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_element_positive_invalid {
        border-top-color: pink;
    }

    .graph_xx .graph_value_element_negative_invalid {
        border-bottom-color: pink;
    }

## Events (scripting)

When a bar's value is increased or decreased by the user, it sends an event with following arguments:

<table border='1'>
     <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>source</td>
        <td>ID of this instance of addon</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>item</td>
        <td>Clicked bar ID in format:<br />

        <pre>
            SERIE_ID COLUMN_ID
        </pre>

        where:
        <ul>
            <li>SERIE_ID is a row index, counted from 0</li>
            <li>COLUMN_ID is a column index in particular row, counted from 0</li>
        </ul></td>
        If all columns are in correct position then item value is 'all'.
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>value</td>
        <td>New value associated with the clicked column.<br /><br />

If you are using Advanced Connector, please note that due to Regular Expression syntax which has special meaning for "-" and "." characters, you need to escape them with backshlash. For example:

<ul>
<li>if you want to match value of -10, you should write "\-10", </li>
<li>if you want to match value 20.5, you should write "20\.5".</li>
</ul>
(in both examples quotes are used only to distinguish value from description, do not copy them to  Advanced Connector's script).
<br/><br />
If 'Decimal separator' property was filled, new value will contain specified decimal separator.<br />
If all columns are in correct position then value is empty ('').
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>score</td>
        <td>1 if comuln is correct, 0 if column is incorrect<br />
        If all columns are in correct position then score value is empty ('').</td>
    </tr>
</table>
