## Description

For General and Quantity inputs, you can ask student for more than one answer to a single question. 
To do so the "Compound answer" must be selected.

    NOTE: Although WIRIS supports both “All answers must be correct” and “Distribute grade” options the player 
    treats both as if the “All answers must be correct” option was selected.
