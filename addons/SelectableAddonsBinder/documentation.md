## Description

Selectable Addons Binder is a special kind of addon which controls groups of selectable addons. After selecting one of the addons from a group, all other addons are deselected (so only one addon from the group is selected). The only thing that a user has to provide is the information which addons belong to the group.

##Properties

<table border='1'>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Property name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Addons</td>
        <td>A list of addons. Each row should be composed of an addon ID.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Sample configuration

    Image_Identification1    
    Image_Identification2    
    Image_Identification3    
    Image_Identification4   
    Image_Identification5    
    Image_Identification6    

This configuration creates a group of 6 Image Identification Addons, allowing the selection of only one of them.

##Supported commands

<table border='1'>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Command name</th>
        <th>Params</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>---</td>
        <td>---</td>
        <td>---</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Advanced Connector integration

Selectable Addons Binder doesn't support any commands so there is no way to integrate it with Advanced Connector.

## Scoring

Selectable Addons Binder is not an activity module, so there is no scoring present.

##Events

Selectable Addons Binder does not send any events to Event Bus. It only reacts to them.

##CSS classes

  <table border='1'>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Class name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

            <td>---</td>
            <td>---</td>
        </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
