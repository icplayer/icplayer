## Description
The Ordering module enables to insert a ready-made activity template with  different, pre-defined items which can be determined either by texts or by images. All the elements are automatically disarranged and are to be put in the correct order.  Each time the page is re-entered or the activity is reset, a new random order is generated. It is possible to place the items either vertically or horizontally, depending on the activity type. 

The module allows to indicate multiple items, their content and of course the correct order. The correct answers are not counted individually, the Ordering activity is to be solved right or wrong as a whole. However, it is possible to define more than one correct order.
